In order to establish a good and thought-out api for libresource we would like
to hear your suggestions. The following questions might serve as a short
guideline:

1) What classes are useful?
2) What queries are useful in what class?
3) How would a function for each of these queries look like?

If you want to make a proposal, please create a file in this folder. It should
follow the naming convention:

        api_YOURUSERNAME.md

Place your ideas for an api in this file. Once you are happy with your proposal
you can submit it for discussion. We do not expect a full-blown outline for an
api. If you can come up with a reasonable outline for some classes and
functions this is alright. Unless obvious, please try to make a brief argument
why a certain class is useful.
