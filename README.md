# libresource

libresource is a community effort to generate a new library which tools
like ps, top, etc can use to get information typically garnered from
/proc.  libresource however will attempt to virtualize the data according
to the calling task's cgroup information.

# contributing

We will interact through pull requests and the issue tracker.  I think we
should start with pull requests editing the CONTRIBUTORS so we can have a
feel whether enough people are able to contribute or interested in following
for the project to be successful.  We can also start pull requests against
the specs/api.md file to discuss what that should look like.
